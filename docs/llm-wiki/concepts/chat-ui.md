# Chat UI

The chat panel is a **JCEF browser** rendering streamed Claude responses as HTML, paired with a Swing input area. `ChatPanel` is the EDT-bound coordinator: it observes the `CliBridge.events` flow, hands events to `EventStreamHandler` for HTML rendering through `MessageRenderer`, and routes user input through the slash-command pipeline. Most subsystems (edit review, permission prompts, mention autocomplete, drift banner, task widget, model picker) attach to `ChatPanel` as collaborators rather than living inside it.

## Gotchas

- All HTML mutation must go through `MessageRenderer` and `appendHtml` on the EDT — direct JCEF JS injection bypasses the renderer's sanitization and ref-link handling.
- `ChatPanel` does **not** own the `CliBridge`. The bridge is shared per-project, so two chat panels (e.g. tool window + popup) observing the same project see the same event stream.
- `EditReviewCoordinator` capture happens in the chat panel's event handler; if a built-in Edit/Write event is missed there, Layer 2 silent-revert breaks. See [Edit review](edit-review.md).
- `appendHtml` is no-op if the JCEF browser is not yet ready; queued output is replayed on first render via `ChatBrowserRenderer`.
- The thinking/activity indicator is shown once at submit and hidden at turn end, but several mid-turn paths (resume, wake recovery, restart, stall) can drop it — and JCEF can stop painting it during a long, event-sparse sub-agent run. `EventStreamHandler.handleEvent` re-asserts it on each incoming `AssistantMessage`/`ToolResult` by calling `browserRenderer.pokeThinkingIndicator()` (→ `pokeThinking()` JS, which recreates the indicator if absent and nudges a repaint). The gate is `shouldPokeIndicator`: **only** while `isStreaming && !isPaused`, and **only** on those two coarse event kinds — never per-token `TextDelta` (one poke per token would cost a JCEF round-trip each) and never `Result` (it ends the turn and hides the indicator, so poking on it would fight the hide). Because a sub-agent's inner `AssistantMessage`/`ToolResult` events flow through the same handler, this keeps the hint alive for the whole delegated run. See [Subagents](subagents.md).
- **The Swing chrome is responsive to the dock aspect (issue #140).** The leaf controls (tool-approval combo, auto-accept checkbox, Auto/Plan/Ask mode toggle, model/effort combos, cost chip, status + context labels, input area) are built **once** in `buildTitleControls`/`buildBottomControls` and then *reparented* between two arrangements by `applyResponsiveLayout(compact)`. A tall vertical dock keeps the classic two bands (title bar on top, input + status on the bottom); a wide, short **horizontal** dock merges both control bands into one compact top row and shrinks the input so the limited height goes to the conversation. A `ComponentListener` calls `recomputeResponsiveLayout()`, which flips only when the aspect crosses the `ChatPanel.shouldUseCompactLayout` threshold (compact ≥ 1.2, vertical ≤ 1.0, dead-band in between so dragging the splitter near square doesn't flap). A Swing component can only have one parent, so both layouts **share** the same field instances — never construct a second copy of a control per layout.
